# DubDub Series

Play and Learn Together during WWDC

After a week of discovering all the new things that are announced, build something fun, useful, cool, strange or smart with the new APIs and share it with the world! Submit your code and join us on Friday June 10th as we explore new possibilities together!

# How to participate

- Open a new Xcode project and make a new iOS or iPadOS app
- Using less than 200 lines of code and a single SwiftUI file, show off a newly annouced API / framework / feature
- Write a little note in the README of your repo where you explain what you like about the new feature and a bit about how it works
- Create a new public repo for your code
- Add a reference to your project to the README of this repo and make a PR

On friday June 10th we will go through the entries from a special location near Apple Park.
